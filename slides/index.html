This research was conducted while I was at the University of Regina, which is situated on the territories of the nay-hi-yuh-wuk (Cree; nêhiyawak), uh-nish-i-naa-payk (Salteaux; Anihšināpēk), Dakota, Lakota, and Nakoda, and the homeland of the Métis/Michif Nation.

Learning from data involves trade offs

We can have models that fit our data well &amp;mdash; low bias &amp;mdash; but which are highly variable, or

We can fit models that have lower variance, but these tend to have higher bias, i.e. fit the data less well

A linear regression model is very interpretable but unless the underlying relationship is linear it will have poor fit

Deep learning may fit data incredibly well but the model is very difficult to interpret and understand

GAMs are an intermediate-complexity model

# How is a GAM different?

In LM we model the mean of data as a sum of linear terms:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_j \color{red}{ \beta_j x_{ji}} + \epsilon_i$$`

A GAM is a sum of _smooth functions_ or _smooths_

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_j \color{red}{s_j(x_{ji})} + \epsilon_i$$`

where `\(\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)`

---

# More generally

`$$y_i \sim \mathcal{D}(\mu_i, \phi)$$`

`$$g(\mu_i) = \boldsymbol{A}_i\boldsymbol{\gamma} + \sum_j f_j(x_{ji})$$`

Splines are built up from basis functions

Here I'm showing a cubic regression spline basis with 10 knots/functions

We weight each basis function to get a spline. Here all the basisi functions have the same weight so they would fit a horizontal line

---

# Weight basis functions &amp;#8680; spline

But if we choose different weights we get more wiggly spline

Each of the splines I showed you earlier are all generated from the same basis functions but using different weights

How does this help us learn from data?

Here I'm showing a simulated data set, where the data are drawn from the orange functions, with noise. We want to learn the orange function from the data

Fitting a GAM involves finding the weights for the basis functions that produce a spline that fits the data best, subject to some constraints

# Use a wiggliness penalty &amp;mdash; avoid fitting too wiggly models

---

# Wiggliness

`$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} [f^{\prime\prime}]^2 dx = \boldsymbol{\beta}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\beta} = \large{W}$$`

`\(\mathbf{S}\)` is a *penalty* matrix

`\(\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\beta}\)` is a *quadratic* penalty

---

# Making wiggliness matter

`\(W\)` measures **wiggliness**

(log) likelihood measures closeness to the data

We use a **smoothing parameter** `\(\lambda\)` to define the trade-off, to find the spline coefficients `\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)` (and `\(\boldsymbol{\gamma}\)`) that maximize the **penalized** log-likelihood

`$$\mathcal{L}_p = \log(\text{Likelihood})  - \lambda W$$`

# Picking the right wiggliness

.pull-left[
Two ways to think about how to optimize `\(\lambda\)`:

* Predictive: Minimize out-of-sample error
* Bayesian:  Put priors on our basis coefficients
]

.pull-right[
Many methods: AIC, Mallow's `\(C_p\)`, GCV, ML, REML

* **Practically**, use **REML**, because of numerical stability
* Hence `gam(..., method='REML')`
]

---

# Maximum allowed wiggliness

We set **basis complexity** or "size" `\(k\)`

This is _maximum wigglyness_, can be thought of as number of small functions that make up a curve

Once smoothing is applied, curves have fewer **effective degrees of freedom (EDF)**

EDF &lt; `\(k\)`

---

# Maximum allowed wiggliness

`\(k\)` must be *large enough*, the `\(\lambda\)` penalty does the rest

*Large enough* &amp;mdash; space of functions representable by the basis includes the true function or a close approximation to the tru function

Bigger `\(k\)` increases computational cost

In **mgcv**, default `\(k\)` values are arbitrary &amp;mdash; after choosing the model terms, this is the key user choice

**Must be checked!** &amp;mdash; `gam.check()`

---

# Knots?

Can avoid the knot placement problem using low-rank thin plate regression splines

---

# Thin plate splines
Default spline in {mgcv} is `bs = "tp"`

Thin plate splines &amp;mdash; knot at every unique data value

Penalty on wiggliness (default is 2nd derivative)

As many basis functions as data

This is wasteful

---

# Low rank thin plate splines

Thin plate regression spline

Form the full TPS basis

Take the wiggly basis functions and eigen-decompose it

Concentrates the *information* in the TPS basis into as few as possible new basis functions

Retain the `k` eigenvectors with the `k` largest eigenvalues as the new basis

Fit the GAM with those new basis functions

# Central Limit Theorem

???

Central limit theorem shows us that the Gaussian or normal distribution is the sampling distribution for many sample statistics, including sample means, as samples sizes become large

Central limit theorem underlies much of the theory that justifies much of the statistics you learn about in your statistics courses, and supports the use of the Gaussian or normal distribution

# Time-to-event data &amp;mdash; Event history models

Follow-up times `-&gt;` Survival analysis model

Piece-wise exponential model is essentially a Poisson GLM on transformed data &amp;mdash; hazard rate is piece-wise constant within time intervals

--

Piece-wise exponential additive mixed model &amp;mdash, PAMM

Estimate hazard rate as a smooth function rather than a step function

Can include all of *mgcv* 📦 tools for splines &amp; effects

# Summary

GAMs &amp; penalized splines are a good choice for modelling messy spatio-temporal
data

Models are Bayesian (empirical or fully Bayes) &amp;mdash; posterior

Penalised splines are in a wide range of software

* *mgcv*, *brms*, *bamlss*, *BayesX*, *JAGS*

Can handle relatively large data: `mgcv::bam()`

Tools for evaluating fitted models

* *mgcViz*, *gratia*
